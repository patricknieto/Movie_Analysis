####Research Question
Does it benefit a director to choose his actors based on the length of time since their last film? Are actors that appear more
frequently beneficial to the success of the movie, or should the director go out on a limb to give an actor an opportunity for 
a comeback?

I am using linear regression to find if there is a relationship between the time passed since an actors last movie and the
overall success of the movies they have been casted in. Can we predict the peak time to cast an actor in order to gross
the most amount of revenue. 


####Data and Analysis
 
 OLS regression: 
 R**2 of .206
 
 




####Next Steps

Next steps would be to find better data to include, such as actors' income at the time of casting and maybe actor characterstics
such as gender and age.
